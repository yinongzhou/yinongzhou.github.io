  abstract={Confining materials to two-dimensional forms changes the behaviour of the electrons and enables the creation of new devices. However, most materials are challenging to produce as uniform, thin crystals. Here we present a synthesis approach where thin crystals are grown in a nanoscale mould defined by atomically flat van der Waals (vdW) materials. By heating and compressing bismuth in a vdW mould made of hexagonal boron nitride, we grow ultraflat bismuth crystals less than 10 nm thick. Due to quantum confinement, the bismuth bulk states are gapped, isolating intrinsic Rashba surface states for transport studies. The vdW-moulded bismuth shows exceptional electronic transport, enabling the observation of Shubnikov–de Haas quantum oscillations originating from the (111) surface state Landau levels. By measuring the gate-dependent magnetoresistance, we observe multi-carrier quantum oscillations and Landau level splitting, with features originating from both the top and bottom surfaces. Our vdW mould growth technique establishes a platform for electronic studies and control of bismuth’s Rashba surface states and topological boundary modes1,2,3. Beyond bismuth, the vdW-moulding approach provides a low-cost way to synthesize ultrathin crystals and directly integrate them into a vdW heterostructure.},

  abstract={The fine-tuning of topologically protected states in quantum materials holds great promise for novel electronic devices. However, there are limited methods that allow for the controlled and efficient modulation of the crystal lattice while simultaneously monitoring the changes in the electronic structure within a single sample. Here, we apply significant and controllable strain to high-quality HfTe5 samples and perform electrical transport measurements to reveal the topological phase transition from a weak topological insulator phase to a strong topological insulator phase. After applying high strain to HfTe5 and converting it into a strong topological insulator, we found that the resistivity of the sample increased by 190,500% and that the electronic transport was dominated by the topological surface states at cryogenic temperatures. Our results demonstrate the suitability of HfTe5 as a material for engineering topological properties, with the potential to generalize this approach to study topological phase transitions in van der Waals materials and heterostructures.},

  abstract={Thermochromism, the change in color of a material with temperature, is the fundamental basis of optical thermometry. A longstanding challenge in realizing sensitive optical thermometers for widespread use is identifying materials with pronounced thermometric optical performance in the visible range. Herein, it is demonstrated that single crystals of indium selenium iodide (InSeI), a 1D van der Waals (vdW) solid consisting of weakly bound helical chains, exhibit considerable visible range thermochromism. A strong temperature-dependent optical band edge absorption shift ranging from 450 to 530 nm (2.8 to 2.3 eV) over a 380 K temperature range with an experimental (dEg/dT)max value extracted to be 1.26 × 10−3 eV K−1 is shown. This value lies appreciably above most dense conventional semiconductors in the visible range and is comparable to soft lattice solids. The authors further seek to understand the origin of this unusually sensitive thermochromic behavior and find that it arises from strong electron–phonon interactions and anharmonic phonons that significantly broaden band edges and lower the Eg with increasing temperature. The identification of structural signatures resulting in sensitive thermochromism in 1D vdW crystals opens avenues in discovering low-dimensional solids with strong temperature-dependent optical responses across broad spectral windows, dimensionalities, and size regimes.},

An appropriate tensile strain (i.e., beyond 3 %) can induce a transition from indirect bandgap to direct bandgap. In addition, we construct several conceptual nanodevice structures based on β-HfNCl monolayer, such as pn-junction diodes, pin-junction field-effect transistors (FETs) and phototransistors. The electronic transport results reveal that the pn-junction diodes have obvious rectification effect and strong electric anisotropy. Their rectification ratios and electric anisotropy ratio (η) can reach up to 106 and 3.69, respectively. The FETs have an obvious field-effect behavior with a slightly lower rectification ratio (1 0 5). Moreover, we investigate the photoelectric response of the phototransistors of β-HfNCl monolayer under the illumination of light. They have a strong response to the light whose energy is larger than the violet light, indicating that the β-HfNCl monolayer can be a platform to detect the ultraviolet light. These findings provide crucial insights into the potential applications of β-HfNCl monolayer in electronic and optoelectronic devices.},

  abstract={The rediscovery of one-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D (q-1D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals ushered the realization of nascent physical properties in 1D that are suitable for applications including photonics, electronics, and sensing. However, despite renewed interest in the creation and understanding of the physical properties of 1D and q-1D vdW crystals, the lack of accessible synthetic pathways for growing well-defined nanostructures that extend across several length scales remains. Using the highly anisotropic 1D vdW NbS3-I crystal as a model phase, we present a catalyst-free and bottom-up synthetic approach to access ultra-long nanowires, with lengths reaching up to 7.9 mm and with uniform thicknesses ranging from 13 to 190 nm between individual nanowires. Control over the synthetic parameters enabled the modulation of intra- and inter-chain growth modalities to selectively yield 1D nanowires or quasi-2D nanoribbons. Comparative synthetic and density functional theory (DFT) studies with a closely related non-dimerized phase, ZrS3, show that the unusual preferential growth along 1D can be correlated to the strongly anisotropic bonding and dimeric nature of NbS3 Type-I. These results, owing to the ubiquity of dimerization in Peierls-distorted 1D crystals, will open opportunities to grow ultra-long nanowires for high-fidelity optical and electronic devices approaching the sub-nanoscale regime.},

However, experimental growth and synthesis of FB materials have been challenging and have remained elusive for the ideal form of monolayer materials where the FB arises from destructive quantum interference as predicted in 2D lattice models. Here, we report surface growth of a self-assembled monolayer of 2D hydrogen-bond (H-bond) organic frameworks (HOFs) of 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene (THPB) on Au(111) substrate and the observation of FB. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy or spectroscopy shows mesoscale, highly ordered, and uniform THPB HOF domains, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy highlights a FB over the whole Brillouin zone. Density-functional-theory calculations and analyses reveal that the observed topological FB arises from a hidden electronic breathing-kagome lattice without atomically breathing bonds. Our findings demonstrate that self-assembly of HOFs provides a viable approach for synthesis of 2D organic topological materials, paving the way to explore many-body quantum states of topological FBs.},

Though necessary for practical implementation, sophisticated electrical control of molecular beam epitaxy (MBE)-grown quantum anomalous Hall matter have been stymied by growth and fabrication challenges. Here, a novel procedure is demonstrated, employing a combination of thin-film deposition and 2D material stacking techniques, to create dual-gated devices of the MBE-grown quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Cr-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. In these devices, orthogonal control over the field-induced charge density and the electric displacement field is demonstrated. A thorough examination of material responses to tuning along each control axis is presented, realizing magnetic property control along the former and a novel capability to manipulate the surface exchange gap along the latter. Through electrically addressing the exchange gap, the capabilities to either strengthen the quantum anomalous Hall state or suppress it entirely and drive a topological phase transition to a trivial state are demonstrated. The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.},

The crystalline symmetries protect the robustness of their corner states with long-range entanglement, which are robust against time-reversal-breaking perturbations. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of direct control of the topological corner states by introducing the spin degree of freedom in a rhombus-shaped Kekulé nanostructure with local magnetization and local electric potential. By applying a local magnetization on one corner, the other corner can also be strongly spin polarized. By further applying a local electric potential at the same corner, the sign of the spin polarization can be reversed at both corners. We also prove the robustness of the control of the spin polarization under the disorder. Moreover, we demonstrate the material realization in a 𝛾-graphyne nanostructure with Mn adsorption and Si replacement at one corner by using first-principles calculations. Other higher-order lattices and the shape of the nanostructure are also discussed. Our studies give a showcase of the remote correlation of quantum states in higher-order topological materials for spintronic and quantum applications.},

The resulting phase diagram of spin texture shows the potential for controlling phase transition and flipping spin by reducing symmetry through surface cleavage, thickness reduction or strain.

In principle, they are ground-state equilibrium properties characterized by Fermi level lying in a topological gap, below which all the occupied bands are summed to a non-zero topological invariant. Here, we propose theoretical concepts and models of 'excited' QAHE (EQAHE) and EQSHE generated by dissociation of an excitonic insulator (EI) state with complete population inversion (CPI), a unique many-body ground state enabled by two yin-yang flat bands (FBs) of opposite chirality hosted in a diatomic Kagome lattice. The two FBs have a trivial gap in between, i.e. the system is a trivial insulator in the single-particle ground-state, but nontrivial gaps above and below, so that upon photoexcitation the quasi-Fermi levels of both electrons and holes will lie in a nontrivial gap achieved by the CPI-EI state, as demonstrated by exact diagonalization calculations. Then dissociation of singlet and triplet EI state will lead to EQAHE and EQSHE, respectively. Realizations of yin-yang FBs in real materials are also discussed.},

We demonstrate a combined study of single-particle Floquet band theory with exact diagonalization (ED) of a many-body Hamiltonian. We show that a time-periodic circularly polarized laser inverts the sign of second-nearest-neighbor hopping in a kagome lattice and enhances spin-orbit coupling in one spin channel to produce a Floquet FB with a high flatness ratio of bandwidth over band gap, as exemplified in monolayer Pt3⁢C36⁢S12⁢H12. The ED of the resultant Floquet-kagome lattice Hamiltonian gives a one-third-filling ground state with a laser-dependent excitation gap of a FQH state, up to an estimated temperature above 70 K.

In solid states, the so-called valley CD may arise microscopically from interband transitions between two chiral electronic valley bands of nonzero Berry curvatures at a given 𝑘 point. However, generally, two sets of 𝐾 and 𝐾′ valleys coexist in the Brillouin zone with opposite chiral selectivities, so that the net CD is zero for the whole material. Here, we demonstrate a giant CD originating from photoexcitation between two chiral Chern flat bands of opposite Chern numbers, namely, the enantiomorphic flat Chern bands. The dissymmetry factor 𝑔 of such flat CD can reach the theoretical maximum value of 2 with the optimal spin-orbit coupling strength.

A prevailing mechanism for the formation of Weyl points is by breaking time-reversal symmetry (TRS) or spatial inversion symmetry of a Dirac point. Here we demonstrate a generic formation mechanism for Weyl points by breaking TRS of a three-dimensional (3D) TI featured with highly degenerate 3D flat bands (FBs). It is in direct contrast to the conventional view that breaking TRS of a 2D/3D TI leads to a Chern insulator exhibiting quantum anomalous Hall effect. Based on a tight-binding model of pyrochlore lattice, we show that this unusual 3D-FB-enabled Weyl state may contain only a minimum of two Weyl points. Furthermore, using first-principles calculations, we identify this Weyl state in a real material Sn2Nb2O7 The main features of the resulting Weyl points are analyzed with respect to symmetry, topological invariant and surface state. Our finding sheds new light on our fundamental understanding of topological physics and significantly extends the scope of Weyl semimetals to attract immediate experimental interest.}

Differing from the widely known conventional 2D Rashba-Dresselhaus (RD) SOC effect that typically exists at surfaces or interfaces, the deep-level nature of SD-SOC states in semiconductors readily makes it an ideal SOC. Remarkably, the spin texture of 1D SD-SOC, pertaining to the inherent symmetry of SD, exhibits a significantly higher degree of spin coherency than the 2D RD-SOC. Moreover, the 1D SD-SOC can be tuned by ionicity in compound semiconductors to ideally suppress spin relaxation, as demonstrated by comparative first-principles calculations of SDs in Si/Ge, GaAs, and SiC. Our findings therefore open a new door to manipulating spin transport in semiconductors by taking advantage of an otherwise detrimental topological defect.}

  abstract={A thickness dependent band gap is commonly found in layered two-dimensional (2D) materials. Here, using a C3N bilayer as a prototypical model, we systematically investigated the evolution of a band gap from a single layer to a bilayer using first principles calculations and tight binding modeling. We show that in addition to the widely known effect of interlayer hopping, de-charge transfer also plays an important role in tuning the band gap. The de-charge transfer is defined with reference to the charge states of atoms in the single layer without stacking, which shifts the energy level and modifies the band gap. Together with band edge splitting induced by the interlayer hopping, the energy level shifting caused by the de-charge transfer determines the size of the band gap in bilayer C3N. Our finding, applicable to other 2D semiconductors, provides an alternative approach for realizing band gap engineering in 2D materials.}

  abstract={Superconductivity is a fascinating quantum phenomenon characterized by zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect. To date, several distinct families of superconductors (SCs) have been discovered. These include three-dimensional (3D) bulk SCs in both inorganic and organic materials as well as two-dimensional (2D) thin film SCs but only in inorganic materials. Here we predict superconductivity in 2D and 3D organic metal–organic frameworks by using first-principles calculations. We show that the highly conductive and recently synthesized Cu-benzenehexathial (BHT) is a Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer SC. Remarkably, the monolayer Cu-BHT has a critical temperature (Tc) of 4.43 K, while Tc of bulk Cu-BHT is 1.58 K. Different from the enhanced Tc in 2D inorganic SCs which is induced by interfacial effects, the Tc enhancement in this 2D organic SC is revealed to be the out-of-plane soft-mode vibrations, analogous to surface mode enhancement originally proposed by Ginzburg. Our findings not only shed new light on better understanding 2D superconductivity but also open a new direction to search for SCs by interface engineering with organic materials.}

  abstract={In the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), the reactivity as a function of the hydrogen adsorption energy on different metal substrates follows a well-known volcano curve, peaked at the precious metal Pt. The goal of turning nonprecious metals into efficient catalysts for HER and other important chemical reactions is a fundamental challenge; it is also of technological significance. Here, we present results toward achieving this goal by exploiting the synergistic power of marginal catalysis and confined catalysis. Using density functional theory calculations, we first show that the volcano curve stays qualitatively intact when van der Waals attractions between a hydrogen adatom and different metal (111) surfaces are included. We further show that the hydrogen adsorption energy on the metal surfaces is weakened by 0.12–0.23 eV when hydrogen is confined between graphene and the metal surfaces, with Ni exhibiting the largest change. In particular, we find that the graphene-modified volcano curve peaks around Ni, whose bare surface already possesses moderate (or marginal) reactivity, and the corresponding HER rate of graphene-covered Ni is comparable to that of bare Pt. A hydrogen adatom has high mobility within the confined geometry. These findings demonstrate that graphene-covered Ni is an appealing effective, stable, and economical catalytic platform for HER.}

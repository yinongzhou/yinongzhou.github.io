  abs={The rediscovery of one-dimensional (1D) and quasi-1D (q-1D) van der Waals (vdW) crystals ushered the realization of nascent physical properties in 1D that are suitable for applications including photonics, electronics, and sensing. However, despite renewed interest in the creation and understanding of the physical properties of 1D and q-1D vdW crystals, the lack of accessible synthetic pathways for growing well-defined nanostructures that extend across several length scales remains. Using the highly anisotropic 1D vdW NbS3-I crystal as a model phase, we present a catalyst-free and bottom-up synthetic approach to access ultra-long nanowires, with lengths reaching up to 7.9 mm and with uniform thicknesses ranging from 13 to 190 nm between individual nanowires. Control over the synthetic parameters enabled the modulation of intra- and inter-chain growth modalities to selectively yield 1D nanowires or quasi-2D nanoribbons. Comparative synthetic and density functional theory (DFT) studies with a closely related non-dimerized phase, ZrS3, show that the unusual preferential growth along 1D can be correlated to the strongly anisotropic bonding and dimeric nature of NbS3 Type-I. These results, owing to the ubiquity of dimerization in Peierls-distorted 1D crystals, will open opportunities to grow ultra-long nanowires for high-fidelity optical and electronic devices approaching the sub-nanoscale regime.},

  abs={The fine-tuning of topologically protected states in quantum materials holds great promise for novel electronic devices. However, there are limited methods that allow for the controlled and efficient modulation of the crystal lattice while simultaneously monitoring the changes in the electronic structure within a single sample. Here, we apply significant and controllable strain to high-quality HfTe5 samples and perform electrical transport measurements to reveal the topological phase transition from a weak topological insulator phase to a strong topological insulator phase. After applying high strain to HfTe5 and converting it into a strong topological insulator, we found that the resistivity of the sample increased by 190,500% and that the electronic transport was dominated by the topological surface states at cryogenic temperatures. Our results demonstrate the suitability of HfTe5 as a material for engineering topological properties, with the potential to generalize this approach to study topological phase transitions in van der Waals materials and heterostructures.},

  abs={This study aims to investigate the interplay between chiral-induced spin-orbit coupling along the screw axis and antisymmetric spin-orbit coupling (ASOC) in the normal plane within a chiral crystal, using both general model analysis and first-principles simulations of InSeI, a chiral van der Waals crystal. While chiral molecules of light atoms typically exhibit spin selectivity only along the screw axis, chiral crystals with heavier atoms can have strong ASOC effects that influence spin-momentum locking in all directions. The resulting phase diagram of spin texture shows the potential for controlling phase transition and flipping spin by reducing symmetry through surface cleavage, thickness reduction or strain. We also experimentally synthesized high-quality InSeI crystals of the thermodynamically stable achiral analogue which showed exposed (110) facets corresponding to single-handed helices to demonstrate the potential of material realization for higher-dimensional spin selectivity in the development of spintronic devices.},

  abs={Flat bands (FBs), presenting a strongly interacting quantum system, have drawn increasing interest recently. However, experimental growth and synthesis of FB materials have been challenging and have remained elusive for the ideal form of monolayer materials where the FB arises from destructive quantum interference as predicted in 2D lattice models. Here, we report surface growth of a self-assembled monolayer of 2D hydrogen-bond (H-bond) organic frameworks (HOFs) of 1,3,5-tris(4-hydroxyphenyl)benzene (THPB) on Au(111) substrate and the observation of FB. High-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy or spectroscopy shows mesoscale, highly ordered, and uniform THPB HOF domains, while angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy highlights a FB over the whole Brillouin zone. Density-functional-theory calculations and analyses reveal that the observed topological FB arises from a hidden electronic breathing-kagome lattice without atomically breathing bonds. Our findings demonstrate that self-assembly of HOFs provides a viable approach for synthesis of 2D organic topological materials, paving the way to explore many-body quantum states of topological FBs.},

  abs={In two-dimensional higher-order topological insulators, the corner states are separated by a non-negligible distance. The crystalline symmetries protect the robustness of their corner states with long-range entanglement, which are robust against time-reversal-breaking perturbations. Here, we demonstrate the possibility of direct control of the topological corner states by introducing the spin degree of freedom in a rhombus-shaped Kekul√© nanostructure with local magnetization and local electric potential. By applying a local magnetization on one corner, the other corner can also be strongly spin polarized. By further applying a local electric potential at the same corner, the sign of the spin polarization can be reversed at both corners. We also prove the robustness of the control of the spin polarization under the disorder. Moreover, we demonstrate the material realization in a ùõæ-graphyne nanostructure with Mn adsorption and Si replacement at one corner by using first-principles calculations. Other higher-order lattices and the shape of the nanostructure are also discussed. Our studies give a showcase of the remote correlation of quantum states in higher-order topological materials for spintronic and quantum applications.},

  abs={Quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE) and quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) are two interesting physical manifestations of 2D materials that have an intrinsic nontrivial band topology. In principle, they are ground-state equilibrium properties characterized by Fermi level lying in a topological gap, below which all the occupied bands are summed to a non-zero topological invariant. Here, we propose theoretical concepts and models of 'excited' QAHE (EQAHE) and EQSHE generated by dissociation of an excitonic insulator (EI) state with complete population inversion (CPI), a unique many-body ground state enabled by two yin-yang flat bands (FBs) of opposite chirality hosted in a diatomic Kagome lattice. The two FBs have a trivial gap in between, i.e. the system is a trivial insulator in the single-particle ground-state, but nontrivial gaps above and below, so that upon photoexcitation the quasi-Fermi levels of both electrons and holes will lie in a nontrivial gap achieved by the CPI-EI state, as demonstrated by exact diagonalization calculations. Then dissociation of singlet and triplet EI state will lead to EQAHE and EQSHE, respectively. Realizations of yin-yang FBs in real materials are also discussed.},

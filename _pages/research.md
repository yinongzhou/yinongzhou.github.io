<h3><b>Topological Materials</b></h3>
<h5 style="color: #0c2340;"><b>Topological Flat Band</b></h5>
An important question that often intrigues condensed matter physicists is whether the quantum Hall effects on Landau levels can be generalized to Bloch bands in the absence of an external magnetic field. The topological flat band is just like a counterpart of the Landau levels, characterized by a Chern number. The dispersionless topological flat band, which arises from the destructive interference of Bloch wavefunctions, magnifies any finite electron-electron interaction due to the complete quenching of electronic kinetic energy. We are interested in studying the intriguing properties of the flat-band materials.

<h3><b>Chiral Materials</b></h3>
Chiral structures, found in abundance in nature, range from the spirals of galaxies to the molecular foundations of life. Chiral materials can exist on various scales, encompassing not only molecules but also larger structures, including specific chiral crystals. In crystalline structures, geometric chirality-induced screw symmetry leads to unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties, such as magneto-chiral dichroism, magnetic skyrmions, and electrical magnetochiral anisotropy, paving the way for diverse applications in optics, spintronics, electronics, catalysis, and beyond. Recently, we studied the chiral-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect and thermochromic behavior of chiral crystals.

<h3><b>Superconductors</b></h3>
Superconductivity, a fascinating quantum phenomenon characterized by zero electrical resistance and the Meissner effect, is an area where continuous efforts are made to elevate the critical temperature (Tc). Our goal is to investigate the mechanisms and novel superconductors with high Tc. Recently, we are interested in the unanticipated enhancement of superconductivity observed at metal oxide interfaces.

<p>I am starting as an Assistant Professor at Auburn University in Fall 2024!</p>
<p>I am recruiting PhD students and Postdocs! </p>

<h5><b>Research Interests</b></h5>
My research focuses on developing and applying density functional theory (DFT) simulations coupled with theoretical models to design and predict diverse nanomaterials and quantum materials and reveal their novel electronic, topological, magnetic, optical, and phononic properties.

<h5><b>Bio</b></h5>
I am an Assistant Professor at <a href='https://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/physics/index.htm'>Department of Physics</a> at <a href='https://www.auburn.edu'>Auburn University</a>. Before joining AU, I was a Postdoctoral Scholar at <a href='https://uci.edu'>University of California, Irvine</a>, advised by <a href='https://www.physics.uci.edu/wugroup/people.html'>Prof. Ruqian Wu</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. in Materials Science and Engineering at <a href='https://www.utah.edu'>University of Utah</a> in 2021, advised by <a href='https://my.eng.utah.edu/~fliu/index.html'>Prof. Feng Liu</a>. I obtained my B.S. in Applied Physics at <a href='http://en.ustc.edu.cn'>University of Science and Technology of China (USTC)</a> in 2016.

<h5><b>Other Interests</b></h5>
<p>Tennis (3.0), Violin, Zelda</p>
<p>Favorite players: Lionel Messi, Carlos Alcaraz</p>
